In Neovim (or Vim), the concept of "cutting" text is typically handled by the delete or yank (copy) operations, which place the deleted or copied text into the Vim registers (similar to clipboard). Here’s how you can perform actions similar to cutting in Neovim:

### Deleting Text

- **`d`**: This is the delete command, which can be combined with a motion to delete specific text. For example:
  - **`dw`**: Deletes a word starting from the cursor position.
  - **`dd`**: Deletes the entire line the cursor is on.

When you delete text using these commands, Neovim places the deleted text into the unnamed register, effectively "cutting" it, as it's ready to be pasted elsewhere.

### Pasting Text

- **`p`**: Pastes the text from the unnamed register after the cursor or the current line.
- **`P`**: Pastes the text before the cursor or the current line.

### Example Workflow

1. **Cut (Delete)**: Move the cursor to the beginning of a word you want to cut and press `dw`.
2. **Paste**: Move the cursor to the location where you want to paste the cut word and press `p`.

This sequence effectively replicates the cut-and-paste functionality you might be familiar with from other text editors.

### Visual Mode Cutting

If you need to cut a specific section of text:

1. Enter Visual Mode by pressing `v` (for character-wise selection) or `V` (for line-wise selection).
2. Use the cursor keys to select the text.
3. Press `d` to cut the selected text.

### Using Registers

If you want to cut text without affecting the unnamed register, you can use named registers:

- **Cut to a named register**: `"adw` cuts a word into register `a`.
- **Paste from a named register**: `"ap` pastes the contents of register `a`.

These features make Neovim versatile in handling cut, copy, and paste operations in a manner that is powerful but may require some adjustment if you are used to typical GUI-based text editor shortcuts.
In Neovim (or Vim), there isn’t a direct equivalent to the common “Select All” command found in most GUI text editors, where you can highlight all text with a shortcut like Ctrl+A. However, you can achieve a similar effect using a few different methods, depending on what you intend to do with the selected text.
